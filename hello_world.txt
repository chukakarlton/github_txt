STORY OF MY LIFE
About Chuka
My name is Chuka Carlton Eze, i hail from Udi in Enugu State Nigeria. I am the eldest of 3 siblings from the same
parents; Chuka and Ngozi Eze.

The beggining
I was born on the 27th of october in lagos. My early years wasnt easy at all, as i was sickly and after much
findings it was discovered i had athsma from my dad which is hereditary but stories suggested he wasnt admitting
he had it.
I was a smart kid growing up, started school as early as 2 years. My parents said i shocked them when they discovered 
i was able to read a newspaper.
Things got more difficult when my dad lost his means if income, things got tough for the family so my grandmum
of blessed memory suggested we come down to Enugu to stay with her.
This didnt stop me because i was still going and pushing with good grades, i remember an incident in Primary Four,
when i got home with 2nd position. My dad had to check my average score and he found out i actually came first.
Going into Secondary was quite stressful, although i had scored well in my common entrance there wasnt the 
funds to carry out the whole process.
