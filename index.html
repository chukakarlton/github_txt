parents; Chuka and Ngozi Eze.</p>

<h2>The begining</h2>
<p>I was born on the 27th of october in lagos. My early years wasnt easy at all, as i was sickly and after much
findings it was discovered i had athsma from my dad which is hereditary but stories suggested he wasnt admitting
 he had it.</p>
<p>I was a smart kid growing up, started school as early as 2 years. My parents said i shocked them when they discovered 
    i was able to read a newspaper.</p>
    <p>Things got more difficult when my dad lost his means if income, things got tough for the family so my grandmum
        of blessed memory suggested we come down to Enugu to stay with her.</p>
